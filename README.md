# Automating-Quality-Inspection-for-Fabricated-Steel-Parts
Overview: This project focuses on automated defect detection and localization in steel sheets using Deep Learning.
It combines classification (MobileNetV2) to quickly flag defective sheets and segmentation (U-Net) to precisely highlight defect regions.

## Problem Statement
- Steel industries need accurate and fast defect detection to ensure product quality. Manual inspection is:
- - Time-consuming
  - Inconsistent (depends on human accuracy)
  - Expensive for large-scale production

## Approach
1. Classification ‚Äì ResNet50
   - Model Choice: Tested multiple CNNs; ResNet50 gave best speed vs accuracy balance.
   - Why ResNet50: best balance of accuracy + robustness.
   * Pipeline:
     - Input image ‚Üí ResNet50 backbone
     - Customized classification head ‚Üí Dense layers + Dropout
     - Output ‚Üí Defect / No Defect label
    * Example Output:

2. Segmentation ‚Äì U-Net
   - Used U-Net encoder‚Äìdecoder to locate exact defect regions.
   - Produces pixel-wise masks showing defect boundaries.
   - Outperformed other segmentation methods with cleanest boundaries.
   * Pipeline:
     - Input image ‚Üí Encoder (extracts features)
     - Decoder reconstructs spatial info ‚Üí segmentation mask
     - Overlay mask on original image for visualization
     
     * Example Output:
       - Original Image ‚Üí Steel surface with rust/wear
       - Segmentation Mask ‚Üí Green highlighted defective regions
